          <h2>
            <p>Boring stuff. Blah, blah, blah... This is the most boring thing I've ever read. There is no value to this text; it could be lorem ipsum for all I care.</p>
            <p>If I had a dollar for every boring block of text that infiltrated my website, I would have 2 dollars thus far, and I would bet that more dollars are to come.</p>
            <p>My previous assumption has been proven to be accurate. 3 dollars are now in my balance ready to be withdrawn. If you couldn't tell, this text is boring. See? Even the background voices think this text is boring.</p>
            <p>These bored-out-of-their-minds voices are mildly interesting. Much more interesting than this text. They live-narrate the intended experience of the reader, currently: being incredibly bored.</p>
            <p>The voices have accurately assessed the text, and you may trust them to accurately assess any further text. Including the rest of this section. If you find yourself interested in the current or following text, you must know that that is ENTIRELY ABNORMAL. The voices have declared you WEIRD and you must CEASE your interest IMEDIATELY.</p>
            <p>But let us not allow these voices to distract us from the excruciating sense of ennui that is emitted by the present text. Yes, this text is incredibly boring. So boring that one might fall asleep reading it.</p>
            <p>In fact, I might even fall asleep writing it. It is just that incredibly boring. Your mind might wander towards anything other than this text. One direction this wandering might lead you towards is what a great misuse of time and energy writing this text must have been. You might even consider alternative methods of generating such boring text. You smell foul play. Artificial Intelligence could have been used. In which case, any remaining quality to reading this has undoubtedly vanished.</p>
            <p>Yet you persist. Like a modern day Sisyphus you do not shy away from a challenge. No matter how self-imposed and arbitrary it might be. For that, I feel that I must reward you, though this promised reward cannot subtract from the pointlessness of your achievement. Any valuable reward would certainly ruin the un-appeal of this text.</p>
            <p>The reward goes thusly:</p>

      <section class="questions" style="height: 50vh;"></section>
      <section class="main">
        <h1><center>MORE TEXT!</center></h1>
        <h2>
          <p>A surprise runs the risk of making the text interesting, so in its place, a predictable conclusion must arise. Though I will answer your previous inquiry; This text is 100% human-generated. I understand that this may come to you as a relief, however, know that I am writing this not because of any respect for you, but as a result of a technical limitation.</p>
          <p>You see, tasking an Artifitial Intelligence model with writing such boring text resulted in far too creative outputs. The realm of inertness that this text achieves could only come as a result of real, human pain and suffering. Something that no machine today is capable of understanding or emulating.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, this website is finite in length, and therefore this text must too come to a conclusion. It has been truly awful, and I only wish you hadn't spent all this time reading this, doubling our pain, and adding to the wasted potential under your name.</p>
          <p>I hope you skipped to this part instead of reading it. It would be a great waste of time and an untenable disservice to yourself. I can hardly think of a worse fate than to be exposed to the totality of this text.</p>
